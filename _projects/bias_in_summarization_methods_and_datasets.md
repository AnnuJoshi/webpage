title: Bias in Summarization Methods and Datasets
description: |
    There has been a lot of development in the field of text summarization but the logic behind the bias of this task is still unexplored. The system architecture and the corpus still questions the generalizability of this task like for news summarization the position of the sentences is a pretty known bias, so here we investigate the systems and the datasets used for summarization to find their individual biases and rank these biases on our custom scale to provide some helping guidelines for new datasets and systems to come.
