title: Multimodel Abstractive Summarization

description: |
    Textual content has its pros in communicating with impact but visual trumps all senses. There has been a significant research in the field of text summarization but the majority of the techniques uses a single form of data that results either in text summarization or video summarization but here we are putting the power of NLP and combining it with the multi stream neural network architecture to fuse video, Images and audio along with text summaries.
