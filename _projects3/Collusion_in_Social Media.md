<h2>Overview</h2>
Online media has been increasingly used to express opinions, promote brands and share news. Often, the popularity of an online media entity (tweet, video, status etc.) is denoted by how other users of the platform are reacting to it in the form of appraisals (retweet, follow, like, comment, subscribe etc.). The natural way of gaining appraisals is a time-consuming process that leads to the creation of unfair methods of gaining a high number of appraisals. The goal of this project is to develop techniques to detect such collusive activities facilitated by blackmarket services.
