<h4><b>Overview:</b></h4>
Past two decades have witnessed the rapid growth of scientific publications in all areas of research. Easier
access to published literature (open access, arxiv preprints, etc.) coupled with the advances in
computational technologies, has provided data scientists a fertile ground to explore, study and analyze
vast amounts of scholarly data available. Scholarly data mining has thus made it possible to do “research
about research!” It plays a vital role in scientometrics, bibliometrics, webometrics, and altmetrics, that
require applying sophisticated algorithms to curate and derive useful insights from scholarly data.
Moreover, the knowledge extracted from the scientific data can help in several decision making processes
such as policy making for fund disbursement, identifying research gap in a department and recruiting
faculties to fill up the gap, speculating upcoming research areas, etc. On the other hand, the increasing
popularity and use of these metrics as a measure of ​ quality of research output, for determining university
rankings, and in decision making (tenure and recruitment decisions), has also given rise to objectionable
practices to artificially boost these measures (self citations, citation-cliques, etc.). Given that, is it always
right to consider these metrics as a reliable proxy of research quality? How should decision and policy
makers use these metrics to account for such malpractices.

This special issue aims to bring together the latest groundbreaking research on issues related to
knowledge extraction and deriving insights from scientific data. Of special interest is the role these
metrics play in policy and decision making -- both positives and negatives. We welcome both theoretical
and empirical research, and case studies that lead to the development of novel algorithms, tool,
techniques, metrics, decisions and measurements related to scholarly data. The papers submitted to this
special issue should provide insights, analysis, and understanding about the "scientific research" that
would otherwise not have been possible by traditional methods and offer recommendations for the
decision and policymakers about use of such metrics.

<h4><b>Topics of Interests:</b></h4>
We invite submission of high-quality manuscripts reporting relevant research in the area of collecting,
managing, mining, and understanding scientific data. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Information Visualization techniques in knowledge discovery from scientific data
* Information extraction and text-mining approaches for semantic enrichment of scientific data
* Ontology driven knowledge discovery from scientific data
* Case-based reasoning systems from scientific data
* Applications of semantic web in scientific domain
* Automatic categorization and clustering of scientific publications
* Academic recommender and prediction systems
* Metrics to quantify scientific impact
* Ethics and bias in scientific metrics
* Policy making, law, privacy and intellectual properties related scientific publication
* Human-computer interaction for efficient access of scholar data
* Role of online media in the spread of scientific knowledge
* Applications of mining from scientific data
<br>
<h4><b>Submission Instructions:</b></h4>
Manuscripts must be submitted through the Expert Systems electronic submission system at
<a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/exsy">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/exsy</a> (select “Special Issue on mining knowledge from Scientific Data”
as the manuscript type). Submissions shall adhere to the Wiley’s instructions and guidelines for authors
available at the journal web site: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394</a>. Papers will be
evaluated for their originality, contribution significance, soundness, clarity, and overall quality. The
interest of contributions will be assessed in terms of technical and scientific findings, contribution to the
knowledge and understanding of the problem, methodological advancements, and/or applicative value.
