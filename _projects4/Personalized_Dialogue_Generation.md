<h2>Overview</h2>
Generating dialogues using Neural architectures for non-goal-oriented dialogue systems (chit-chat task) is a complex problem, especially when the personalized response is required. This project is exploring various neural techniques for generating a coherent and personalized response. Another goal of this project is also to derive key features that make the conversation human and utilize those features in developing more convincingly human-like chatbots.
