<h2>Overview</h2>
We perform a detailed analysis of the existing network growth models (e.g., BA model) and analyze the temporal growth pattern of nodes. We propose a generic location-based model to accurately simulate the temporal categories and their respective growth behavior observed in a real-world citation network.
